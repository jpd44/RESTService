POC and Recommendations

1. Recap from last session
- How can we handle DR scenarios?
- How can we deploy the application with zero downtime?
- How do we bake security in the design, day 1?
- Whiteboarded potential architecture

2. What we have today
- POC RESTful API and live demo using VPC, EC2, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk
    - EB interface: resource settings, scaling policies, etc.
    - Developer workflow: Grails, git, new EB version
    - Good practices: separate application, resource, database deployments, managed OS updates
        - code: "All-at-once"
        - Resource: "rolling"
        - database: special handling

- Demonstrate a zero-downtime deployment with Elastic Beanstalk
    - DNS swap (with rollback)

- Demonstrate an database failover with RDS

3. Next steps
- Pricing estimate
- Further automation with Git, CodePipeline
